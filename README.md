# Write a Data Science blog post on Medium
This project is part of the Data Science nano degree program from Udacity. The post can be found here: https://marcusmvls-vinicius.medium.com/5-thoughts-about-airbnb-in-seattle-1de5dc9b2a73

# Introduction
As motivation to write my post I used a dataset about AirBNB of Seattle available on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data. The objective was to answer the following 5 questions by analyzing, cleaning, modeling and creating visualizations to back hypothesis and reach conclusions.

    ## Q1 — What season is less/more available?
    - Q2 — Which neighbourhoods are more/less expensive?
    - Q3 — What locations have the best ratings?
    - Q4 — What is the relationship between prices and review scores?
    - Q5 — What season is more expensive?
