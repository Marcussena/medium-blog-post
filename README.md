# Write a Data Science blog post on Medium
This project is part of the Data Science nano degree program from Udacity. The post can be found here: https://marcusmvls-vinicius.medium.com/5-thoughts-about-airbnb-in-seattle-1de5dc9b2a73

# Introduction
As motivation to write my post I used a dataset about AirBNB of Seattle available on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data. The objective was to answer the following 5 questions by analyzing, cleaning, modeling and creating visualizations to back hypothesis and reach conclusions.

 #### Q1 — What season is less/more available?
 #### Q2 — Which neighbourhoods are more/less expensive?
 #### Q3 — What locations have the best ratings?
 #### Q4 — What is the relationship between prices and review scores?
 #### Q5 — What season is more expensive?
 
 # Environment
 I used Python 3 in a Jupyter notebook to coding, modeling, cleaning and creating plots that lead me to the conclusions of my post. The libraries that I used were:
 
   1. Pandas
   2. Numpy
   3. Matplotlib
   4. Statsmodels
   
 # File description
   a. archive.zip - zipped folder containing three datasets used in this work (calendar.csv, listings.csv, reviews.csv)
   b. seattledataset.ipynb - jupyter notebook explaining the code used to achieve the result and visualizations showed in the post
